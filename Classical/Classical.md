`Properties`
- contradiction (i.e. if `Â¬f` and `f` hold every formula holds)
- law of excluded middle (also decidability of classical logic)
- removal of double negation

`Language`
- restricting interpretations to languages
- increasing restricted language preserves satisfiability
- restriction to language preserves satisfiability
