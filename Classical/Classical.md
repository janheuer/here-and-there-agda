# Classical

`Base`
- classical interpretations
- model relation 
- validity of formulas

`Tautologies`
- contradiction (i.e. if `Â¬f` and `f` hold every formula holds)
- law of excluded middle 
- removal of double negation

`Eval`
- alternative definition of the model relation based on an `eval` function mapping interpretations and formulas to booleans
- equivalence proof of both model relation

`Language`
- restricting interpretations to languages
- increasing restricted language preserves satisfiability
- restriction to language preserves satisfiability
